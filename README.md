# ðŸš€ TrustID: Blockchain-Powered Digital Identity Verification

TrustID is a blockchain-powered digital identity verification system that ensures secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable credentials. Built on **Hyperledger Indy** and **PostgreSQL**, TrustID allows users to manage and share their credentials (e.g., National ID, Passports, Degrees) with organizations in a privacy-preserving, decentralized way.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- âœ… **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** for secure user authentication
- âœ… **Verifiable Credentials** stored on blockchain for authenticity
- âœ… **Automated Data Extraction** using OCR/AI for easy document verification
- âœ… **Revocation Registry** to track and prevent fraudulent credentials
- âœ… **Seamless Integration** for organizations to verify credentials in real-time

## ðŸ“Œ Explanation of Folders

### ðŸŸ¢ `data_ingestion/`
Handles collecting and importing data from different sources:
- **`blockchain_listener.py`** â†’ Monitors Hyperledger Indy for new/verifiable credentials.
- **`api_ingestion.py`** â†’ Extracts user & credential data from the app.
- **`file_ingestion.py`** â†’ Loads credentials uploaded as CSV/JSON.
- **`scheduler.py`** â†’ Automates ingestion tasks (e.g., periodic updates).

### ðŸ”µ `data_processing/`
Processes and cleans incoming data:
- **`transformations.py`** â†’ Cleans, formats, and deduplicates data.
- **`encryption.py`** â†’ Encrypts user credentials using OpenSSL.
- **`identity_resolution.py`** â†’ Ensures unique identities (prevents duplicates).

### ðŸŸ¡ `storage/`
Manages where and how data is stored:
- **`models/`** â†’ Contains schemas for databases.
  - `blockchain_schema.sql` â†’ Structure for storing verified credentials on Hyperledger Indy.
  - `relational_schema.sql` â†’ Structure for storing user data & unverified credentials in PostgreSQL.
  - `document_store.json` â†’ (Optional) JSON-based structure for extra metadata.
- **`storage_manager.py`** â†’ Controls data storage and retrieval.

### ðŸŸ  `integration/`
Links the data pipeline to the app and verification processes:
- **`data_api.py`** â†’ API that allows the app to access stored credentials.
- **`event_notifier.py`** â†’ Sends alerts when a credential is updated or verified.

### ðŸŸ£ `config/`
Stores configuration files:
- **`settings.yaml`** â†’ Configurations for ingestion, storage, and security.
- **`secrets.env`** â†’ Stores sensitive environment variables (e.g., DB passwords).

### âšª `tests/`
Ensures correctness with automated testing:
- **`test_ingestion.py`** â†’ Tests if data ingestion works as expected.
- **`test_processing.py`** â†’ Tests data cleaning and transformation logic.
- **`test_storage.py`** â†’ Ensures proper database interactions.

### âš« `scripts/`
Helper scripts for setting up the system:
- **`setup_db.py`** â†’ Initializes PostgreSQL and Hyperledger Indy.
- **`load_sample_data.py`** â†’ Adds sample credentials for testing.

### ðŸ“œ `docs/`
Contains documentation:
- **`architecture.md`** â†’ Explains how data flows through the system.
- **`storage_design.md`** â†’ Describes the database schemas.


## âœ… Summary of TrustID's Data Flow

1. **Users register** on the TrustID app, entering personal info & credentials.
2. **Data ingestion** collects user data via API, files, and blockchain events.
3. **Processing layer**:
   - Cleans data.
   - Encrypts credentials.
   - Prevents duplicate identities.
4. **Storage**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores unverified credentials & user metadata.
   - **Hyperledger Indy**: Stores only **verified** credentials.
5. **Verification Requests**:
   - A **verifier** requests access to a credential.
   - System checks Hyperledger Indy for verified credentials.
   - If found, **access is granted**; if not, the user is asked to verify.
6. **Users can share** their credentials securely through the system.
